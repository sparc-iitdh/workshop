* Wind Instruments: Pipe impulse response
* Measurements: Vibrational/acoustic measurement techniques

**Note to Participants**: The lab sessions involve hands-on exercises to apply the tools and techniques learnt in the lecture. Participants are encouraged to bring their own laptops to work on exercises. A limited number of computers at IIT Dharwad will be available to participants. It is preferred to have MATLAB installed for doing exercises, while Python/Octave could be also used by participants if they are familiar with it. Participants bringing their own laptops are requested to install these packages on their computers.
